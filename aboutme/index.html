		<p>
			My name is Reed Cannon. I am from Cave Creek, Arizona. I am a software engineering major. 
            I enjoy disc golfing, hanging out with friends, song-writing with my wife, and cooking.  
            My favorite thing about BYU Idaho is the people I have met.

			I look forward to learning more about web design because I think it will be of great 
            personal use, in addition to being useful for my career. I am hoping that I might be 
            able to find a job working on web design while I finish my degree.
